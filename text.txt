I'm a dedicated and hardworking individual, thriving both independently and as part of a team. I consider myself a lifelong learner, always eager to dive into new challenges and immerse myself in solving them. My strong communication skills and keen problem-solving abilities are points of pride for me. In my spare time, I enjoy playing chess, skating, reading, and working on various personal projects.

If you'd like to check out my past projects, visit the Portfolio section in the navigation menu. More information on the SCS scheme, where I honed my skills, can be found in the SCS Scheme section. Any code snippets are available in the Code Examples section.
